import <CountDown /> Component and you can pass props including:
styles object using css-module,
title string, by default it's Time Left,
secs number, that's the total seconds you want to use to make countDown.

When you run npm start, the test prop value for secs I pass to CountDown
is 5000 in src/App.js.
